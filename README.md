# Start

Start of my first git project that will combine bunch of tools to develop app that will be able to handle aerodynamic numerical investigation

git status - checking changes between local and online repository
git add - adding wanted files to the commit ("git add ." - adds all new files)
git reset or git reset <file_name> - removing changes from commit
git commit -m "title" -m "message" - creating a local commit
git reset HEAD~1 - uncommiting last change
git push - sending commit to the online repository
git pull - updates local repository 
git branch - checks on which branch we are currently working on
git branch -d <branch_name> - delating branch
git checkout <branch_name> - changing branches
git checkout - b <branch_name> - creating new branch 
git diff <branch_name> - checking differences between current and given branch
git merge <branch_name> - merging current and given branch
